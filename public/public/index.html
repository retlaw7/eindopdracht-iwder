                <h2>What is SSX 3?</h2>
                <p>SSX 3 is a snowboarding game from 2003. The game came out on the ps2,
                 gamecube, xbox and gameboy advance. The game has a metacritic score
                of 93 and earned the award must-play. Over the years the game has aged,
                but the overall gameplay is still fun to pick up. You can do insane tricks at ease
                or go down the mountain at insane speeds to get to the finish and get that first place.</p>

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>In the game you have 3 peaks, for each peak you have different events,
                race events and style events. In race events it's as simple as going down the
                mountain and not finishing last. The style events are all based around doing as many
                tricks as possible as you go down the mountain. You start at peak 1 and once you've done
                all events for one style of events you may continue to the next peak.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Before <mark class="ssx">SSX 3</mark> there were 2 other SSX titles,
                <mark class="ssx">SSX</mark> and <mark class="ssx">SSX Tricky</mark>.
                After <mark class="ssx">SSX 3</mark> there were <mark class="ssx">SSX On Tour</mark>,
                <mark class="ssx"> SSX Blur</mark> and <mark class="ssx"> SSX</mark>
                (mainly referred to as <mark class="ssx"> SSX 2012</mark>).</p>
                <p>The game has seen quite the changes throughout the years in gameplay, what started
                as a fun goofy game where you can do as many tricks as you want, in a world that has been
                shaped like only your wildest dreams could imagine, transformed into a more realistic
                less fantasized goofy kind of game. After the 2012 version, many people left
                the game completely and are still hoping on a return on one of the greatest games
                of all time. The speedrunning community is alive and well!</p>
