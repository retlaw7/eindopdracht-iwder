                style race events and style events. In race events it's as simple as go down the
                mountain and don't finish last. The style events are all based around doing as many
                tricks as possible as you go down the mountain. You start at peak 1 and once you've done
                all events for one style of events you may continue to the next peak.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Before <mark class="ssx">SSX 3</mark> there were 2 other SSX titles,
                <mark class="ssx">SSX</mark> and <mark class="ssx">SSX Tricky</mark>.
                After <mark class="ssx">SSX 3</mark> there were <mark class="ssx">SSX On Tour</mark>
                ,<mark class="ssx"> SSX Blur</mark> and <mark class="ssx"> SSX</mark>
                (mainly referred to as <mark class="ssx"> SSX 2012</mark>).</p>
                <p>The game has seen quite the change throughout the years in gameplay, what started
                as a fun goofy game where you can do as many tricks as you want, in a world that has been
                shaped like only your wildest dreams could imagine, transformed into a more realistic
                less fantasized goofy kind of game. After the 2012 version, many people left
                the game completely and are still hoping on a return on one of the greatest games
                of all time.</p>
